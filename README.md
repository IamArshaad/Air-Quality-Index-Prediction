# Air quality forecasting using FB Prophet model

# Overview
This project focuses on predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) values using the FB Prophet model. The dataset used for this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository - Air Quality Dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality). By analyzing and forecasting AQI, this project aims to provide valuable insights for air quality management and public health.
